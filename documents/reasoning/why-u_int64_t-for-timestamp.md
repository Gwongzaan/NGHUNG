**Explanation and Key Differences:**

* **Unsigned 64-bit Integer `u_int64_t` :**
    * Guaranteed to be an unsigned 64-bit integer.
    * Specifically designed for representing non-negative values.
    * Ideal for timestamps because time is typically measured as a count of units since a specific epoch (e.g., the Unix epoch).
    * Using an unsigned type makes it clear that the value should never be negative.
    * This is the preferred choice for timestamps when you want to be explicit about the type's purpose and ensure non-negativity.
* **Signed 64-bit Integer `long long` :**
    * Also a 64-bit integer, but it's signed, meaning it can represent both positive and negative values.
    * While it can hold the same range of positive values as `uint64_t`, it wastes half of its range by supporting negative numbers, which are generally not needed for timestamps.
    * Using a signed type for a timestamp introduces the potential for confusion or errors if negative values are unintentionally used or interpreted.
* **Why `uint64_t` is Generally Preferred for Timestamps:**
    * **Clarity and Intent:** `uint64_t` clearly signals that the value represents a non-negative count.
    * **Avoiding Potential Errors:** Prevents accidental negative values from being used as timestamps.
    * **Maximum Positive Range:** Provides the full 64-bit range for positive values.
    * **Standardization:** It is part of the `<cstdint>` header, which provides portable, fixed-width integer types.
* **Size:**
    * Both `uint64_t` and `long long` are typically 8 bytes (64 bits) on most modern systems.

**In summary:**

For representing timestamps in C++, `uint64_t` is the better choice because it's unsigned, clearly expresses the intent of the variable, and avoids potential errors associated with signed types.
